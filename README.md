## Overview

**SMGLib** is a comprehensive Python library for multi-agent social navigation research and simulation. It provides a unified framework for testing, comparing, and analyzing different collision avoidance algorithms in complex social scenarios like doorways, hallways, and intersections.

### Key Features

ðŸ¤– **Multiple Navigation Algorithms**: Implements state-of-the-art methods including Social-ORCA, Social-IMPC-DR, and Social-CADRL

ðŸ“Š **Comprehensive Metrics**: Automatic calculation of performance metrics including path deviation, velocity smoothness, makespan ratios, flow rates, and success rates

ðŸŽ¯ **Standardized Environments**: Consistent scenario configurations across all methods for fair comparison

ðŸŽ¬ **Rich Visualizations**: Generates GIF animations, trajectory plots, and SVG visualizations

âš¡ **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Simple command-line interface with interactive configuration

## Research Foundation

## Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CRAL-UVA/SMGLib.git
cd SMGLib
```

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Your First Simulation

```bash
python3 run_simulation.py
```

This launches an interactive menu where you can:
- Choose a navigation method (Social-ORCA, Social-IMPC-DR, or Social-CADRL)
- Select an environment (doorway, hallway, intersection)
- Configure agents and parameters
- View results and animations

### 3. Example Results

After running a simulation, you'll see results like:

```
SOCIAL-IMPC-DR RESULTS
Environment: doorway  Success Rate: 100.0% (2/2)  Makespan: 15.00s  Flow Rate: 0.1667

Robot 1   47   1.044  1.576   28.493    0.146  
```

## Performance Metrics Explained

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Description | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Success Rate** | Percentage of agents reaching goals | Higher = better deadlock avoidance |
| **Makespan** | Time for all agents to complete | Lower = more efficient |
| **Flow Rate** | Agents per unit time through bottleneck | Higher = better throughput |

### Per-Agent Metrics

| Metric | Description | Formula |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **TTG** | Time To Goal (steps) | Steps until goal reached |
| **MR** | Makespan Ratio | TTG_agent / TTG_fastest |
| **Avg Î”V** | Average velocity change | Î£\|v(t+1) - v(t)\| |
| **Path Dev** | Path deviation from nominal | L2 norm of trajectory difference |
| **Hausdorff** | Maximum deviation distance | max distance between trajectories |
